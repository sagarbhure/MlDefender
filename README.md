# Image-Based Malware Detection

This repository contains tools and techniques for detecting image-based malware. Hackers use various techniques to hide malware in images such as appending a string of text to the end of a file which does not change the visual appearance of the image, using image steganography to alter several pixels to embed malicious code and exploit vulnerabilities in image file formats to execute malware. 

## Defending Against Image-based Malware

To defend against image-based malware, organizations can use image steganography detection techniques such as analyzing slight color differences between two images, large amount of duplicate colors within an image, and size difference of image as indicators of image steganography. Additionally, organizations can use anti-malware software that is specifically designed to detect image-based malware and educate employees to be vigilant when opening image files from unknown sources.
